## 📝 Problem Statement

Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution, aimed to introduce a new line of credit cards to broaden its market reach. I took on the role of a data analyst to analyze a sample dataset of 4,000 customers. The objective was to uncover key customer insights and provide a data-driven strategy for the launch, including identifying target segments and recommending specific card features.
