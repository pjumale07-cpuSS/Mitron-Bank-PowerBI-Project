# Mitron Bank: A Data-Driven Credit Card Launch Strategy

## 📋 Project Overview
This project was undertaken to help Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution, launch a new line of credit cards. I analyzed a sample dataset of 4,000 customers across five cities to uncover actionable insights. The goal was to move beyond data visualization to create a tangible, data-driven strategy that would inform the design, features, and marketing of the new credit cards.

## ✨ The Data-Driven Outcome
The core of this project was to translate deep data insights into a tangible business strategy. The final recommendation for a **two-card approach** is a direct result of the patterns uncovered during the analysis.

By analyzing spending habits and customer demographics, two distinct customer segments emerged: one driven by everyday essentials and another by lifestyle and travel spending. The proposed "Edge" and "Apex" cards are a **data-driven strategy tailored specifically to these segments**, ensuring that the new product line meets the demonstrated needs of the market and maximizes customer acquisition.
